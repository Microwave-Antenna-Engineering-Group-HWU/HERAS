# HERAS

The present repository contains the source code of the HERAS tool. 

HERAS is a tool developed in Matlab for the analysis of reflector antennas using Physical Optics (PO) theory. Its source code is freely available for educational and research purposes. It comes from the necessity of a flexible tool to provide adaptability to system engineering requirements and can also be of interest to antenna engineers working on the design of reflector antennas.

The current version contains a subset of the developed classes, and additional ones will be included in future releases. 

## Acknowledgements

The tool has been developed by PhD students at Heriot-Watt University, under the supervision of Prof. George Goussetis. For more information on the current and past research activities carried out by the Microwaves and Antenna Engineering Group, check our [website](https://microwaves.site.hw.ac.uk/).  
In particular, the following have contributed to its development:

- Salvador Mercader Pellicer;
- Louis Dufour;
- Alejandro Baldominos;
- Francesco Lisi.
